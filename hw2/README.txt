Hello !
I think both of my functions are working correctly, Originaly my filter wasn't working but once i did the gcc it starting
giving me the correct output when I do make check.  When I did normal make it said I got an error but it didn't tell
me where, and the make check works correctly so I believe all is good. It also keeps making these files filled with binaries,
but it stopped making those once I closed the pipes, but I'm not able to delete them so the bug is gone but I cant get
rid of them im sorry.
thank you havea  good day !!
