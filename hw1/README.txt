Hello !
I believe my functions are all working, I put sleep(2) in between all of them because I thought
they were getting all jumbled together and printing that long list of commands, I know the third
function takes actually forever to load and im still not sure why it does the list.  Im thinking
its because we r CDing and then LSing and mauybe its just listing everyhting in the CD? If this
doesn't happen on your end i probably look crazy it might be because im editing this locally but
im not sure.  Otherwise I think everything is good functionality wise, im sorry if my design
is sloppy its my first time learning a language so independently and you can only learn so
many conventions in 2 weeks (sorry im trying).  If you have any advice on how to make my code
better i'd appreciate it.
have a good day
